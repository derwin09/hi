🧪 TESTING PIN 26 COMPREHENSIVE TEST
==================================================
Step 1: Setting up PIN 26 as output
🔧 Setting up GPIO pin 26 as output
   ✅ Pin 26 configured as OUTPUT (initialized LOW)
✅ Pin 26 successfully configured as output
Step 2: Setting PIN 26 to HIGH
Step 3: Reading PIN 26 after HIGH
   Pin state after HIGH: True (HIGH)
Step 4: Setting PIN 26 to LOW
Step 5: Reading PIN 26 after LOW
   Pin state after LOW: False (LOW)
✅ PIN 26 TEST PASSED
==================================================
✅ GPIO Controller V2 startup test PASSED
